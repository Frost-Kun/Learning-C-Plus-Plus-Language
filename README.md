# What-is-C++
C++ is a common language, make for IT-ers to doing software ecuation, hacking, design,.... The language is debut in 1965 as an iteration of the C programming language. It began as an extension of C but evolved into a different language with distinctive characteristics and features.
C++ is a scalable, object-oriented language, perfect for large, scalable applications thanks to its discrete and direct memory management capabilities and low-level machine functions. Additionally, C++ has the advantage of being both an object-oriented and a procedural language, something very few other languages can boast of.


## Why we should learn C++
5 of things that you need to learn C++:
It’s fast: Newer languages have extra bells and whistles like garbage-collection and dynamic typing, which, while helpful, slow the program's overall execution. C++ doesn't have this additional processing overhead, so it's swift. In addition, C++ is a compiled language, contributing to the high speed.
It’s well-supported: C++ enjoys extensive library support, including third-party libraries, conducive to fast and rapid development.

It’s a mid-level language: That means C++ is great for performing systems programming and building large-scale user applications.

It’s simple: Simple, in this context, means that you can break programs down into logical units and parts. Additionally, it offers many data types and robust library support.

It’s object-oriented: One of the C++ language’s most significant advantages is that it’s object-oriented. Object-oriented support makes it easier for C++ to create maintainable and extensible programs.

It’s machine-independent: Although C++ isn’t platform-independent, it’s machine-independent. This characteristic means it can work on different computer systems regardless of their components. On the other hand, platform-independent means a Windows-compiled program won't run on a Linux system.
 
## Common apps in C++
### Banking Applications
Financial institutions turn to C++ for help with back-end programming. Banking applications process millions of transactions every day, thus requiring high concurrency and low latency support; C++ automatically becomes the preferred choice.

### Browsers
Browser rendering engines need speed, and C++ delivers this in spades. Users want their content to appear quickly and with minimal lag, so these low-latency systems turn to C++ as their go-to programming language.

### Cloud/Distributed Systems
Cloud storage and distributed systems turn to C++ because they are compatible with various machines and connect exceptionally well with the hardware. In addition, the C++ language provides much-needed high concurrency and load tolerance.

### Databases
MySQL and Postgres, two of today’s most widely-used databases, are written in C++ and C, the latter being C++’s predecessor. These databases, in turn, are used in many of today’s most heavily-used applications, like YouTube, for example.

### Embedded Systems
Embedded systems (e.g., digital cameras, digital wristwatches, MP3 players, calculators) use C++ as their primary programming language because it’s closer to the hardware level.

### Libraries
Machine learning libraries such as TensorFlow require high-performance computations, which C++ is ideally suited for.

### Operating Systems
Windows, Linux, and macOS are all programmed in C++, making the language the foundation of a good amount of our digital world. It’s not overstating matters to say that C++ is the backbone of the Internet Age.

### Telephone Switches
C++’s speed makes it the perfect choice for programming devices such as telephone switches, routers, and even space probes!

Here are some organizations and companies that employ the C++ language:

- Adobe
- Amazon
- Apple
- Bloomberg
- Facebook
- Google
- Microsoft
- YouTube
- Spotify

That’s some impressive lineup! But while it’s cool seeing that so many of today’s heavy hitters use C++, it would lend a lot more gravitas to the situation if there were some specifics. Say no more! Here’s a collection of tools and applications that use C++ to one extent or another:

- Adobe Premiere Pro
- Adobe Photoshop
- Apple Safari
- Blender
- Google Chrome
- Linux
- MacOSX
- Microsoft Office
- Microsoft .NET Web services framework
- MongoDB
- Mozilla Firefox
- MySQL
- Postgres
- Redis
- TensorFlow
- Ubuntu
- Unreal-Engine
- Windows OS
## Application Learning C++
There's some applications for learing C++:
##### Visual Studio Code
##### Dev C++
##### Online Web about C++
E.g
  ##### HCMUTE - PoseTona.
